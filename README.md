This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include argument labels when calling a function. The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version.  Argument labels improve code readability and prevent ambiguity, especially in functions with multiple parameters.
